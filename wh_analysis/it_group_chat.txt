8/18/24, 3:45тАпPM - Vijay Sir IT: Dear students,

It is with great joy to see you graduating to the next phase of your life. We have watched you grow into maturity in all spheres of life. Everything that has a beginning must have an end. Few years back, you started your journey at MIT, which has come to an end.  The toughest moment for us as a teacher is when we have to say goodbye to all, but we have no choice its a reality.
I see the potential in all of you, and I believe you will make your dreams come true.
I know you are going out to do exploits and make your teachers & institute proud. 
Your journey with us may stop here, but above all, it is the beginning of new heights for you. We wish you a successful and happy life .Your academic life may have ended but always remember that learning is a never-ending process. On the behalf of the entire faculties, principal, staff members I wish you all, best of luck for your future. There was a time when we used to be little harsh with you but it doesnтАЩt mean that we hate you. If we ever scolded you it was just to make you guys ready for bigger challenges of your life and to make you a better. YouтАЩll be entering into the new world of professional life where challenges are waiting for you. I strongly believe that you all will excel and will face all the difficulties and challenges in a positive way. 
......Stay Blessed &  happyЁЯСНЁЯП╗
